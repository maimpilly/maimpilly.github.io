I have an inertia to putting myself online. 

It’s that mix of hesitation and perfectionism that holds a lot of us back from sharing our work. This website is my solution to that problem, a way to finally push past that initial friction and start building a voice.

I’ve come to feel that this reluctance is just like a muscle for public speaking. Most of us don’t like putting ourselves "out there"; it's a skill that's easy to neglect. I'm hoping this site will be a small, consistent way to start developing it.

### Current Goal: Getting Comfortable

Right now, my goal is simple: get comfortable.

This site is a place for me to do that. The plan is to build out my own "About" page, add some pictures, and mess with the layout and design. It's also the place where I'll write my first blog posts (like this one) to practice sharing my thoughts and what I'm working on.

### Future Goal: Being Useful

Looking ahead, I hope this site evolves. My current goal is about self-expression, but my future goal is about answering a different question: "How can I be useful to other people?"

I want to start sharing lessons from my journey. My goal isn't to be a guru, but to appeal to the small number of people who are just a few steps behind me on the path I've just taken. I want to share the things I wish I knew three, or maybe even five, years ago.

This is that first step. Thanks for reading :)
